## ðŸª› How to Get Started

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the GitHub page.

2. **Make Pull Request**
   After you are done with your modifying, make a PR (Pull Request) to the official RVE repository, our team will review and if it's good enough to be in the final project, it will be approved and you will be on the contributers list in the README!

   ### Things to consider
   Doing these things will make it much easier for us to approve your Pull Request

   - Use clear, readable code with comments so we can see what it does
   - Prefer MIT-compatible libraries only (we don't want to go around messing with LICENSE)
   - UI should be clean and modular

  ðŸ“ƒ By contributing, you agree that your work will be released under the MIT License, in harmony with RVEâ€™s open-source spirit.

  ### What you can help us with
  - Bug reports (Tell us the issue, how to reproduce it, and expected behavior and we will try our best)
  - Cool feature requests (Got any fun ideas that could be used later? Well you can put it here, and we will see what we can do)
  - Pull Requests (Fixing a bug, or adding a feature, make a Pull Request that we can use!)
  - Design & UI (Is our UI not... great, well then you can tell us and we will try and make it better, or you can make a Pull Request with a UI overhaul)
  - Documentaion (Want to help make RVE easier to use, you can help us update our README or other documantation so we can ensure RVE stays easy to use!)


### Final Words
Thank You all for making RVE a better video editor, day by day it will get better and better, so let's make a video editor people want to use.

Built by contributers, for the contributers!
